        I completed my 12th Science from <span class="font-medium">National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS)</span> in the year 2023. This flexible and self-paced learning program allowed me to develop a deep understanding of core scientific subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. Throughout the course, I honed essential academic skills including critical thinking, logical reasoning, and effective time management. The open schooling system also encouraged independent learning, which has played a key role in shaping my discipline and curiosity for knowledge. Completing this program laid the groundwork for my interest in technology and problem-solving.
